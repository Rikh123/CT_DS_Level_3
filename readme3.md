# 📌 Level 3 - Task 3: Data Visualization

## 📝 Objective  
This task focuses on **visualizing restaurant data** to gain insights into customer ratings, cuisine popularity, and other key factors. The main goals are:  

- **Visualize the distribution of ratings** using different chart types (histograms, bar plots, etc.).  
- **Compare the average ratings** of different cuisines or cities.  
- **Explore relationships between various features** and the target variable (restaurant ratings).  

## 📂 Files  
- **task3.py** → Python script for data visualization.  
- **Enhanced_Dataset_Task3.csv** → Processed dataset with extracted features.  

## 📊 Steps Performed  

### 1️⃣ **Rating Distribution Analysis**  
- Created a **histogram** to display the distribution of restaurant ratings.  
- Identified the **most common rating ranges**.  

### 2️⃣ **Cuisine & City Comparison**  
- **Compared average ratings** across different cuisines using a bar chart.  
- **Analyzed city-wise rating trends** to identify top-rated locations.  

### 3️⃣ **Feature Relationships**  
- Explored how **votes, price range, and table booking** affect ratings.  
- Used **scatter plots and correlation heatmaps** to identify patterns.  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- The majority of restaurants have ratings between **3.0 and 4.5**.
